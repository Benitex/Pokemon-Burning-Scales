Pokemon Burning Scales is a Pokemon fan game that focuses on the exploration of a small open world and its story. You'll encounter dozens of characters who will provide interesting interactions, impactful battles, funny moments, and, most importantly, numerous side quests. Made with [Pokémon Essentials](https://github.com/Maruno17/pokemon-essentials) v19.1 and RPG Maker XP.

Pokemon Burning Scales is being translated into English and will be released soon.

## Story

In Pokemon Burning Scales, you play as Nathan, an experienced trainer who has traveled extensively throughout the Pokémon world and is already known to many characters. Currently, he's assisting Professor Juniper in Unova with research on an unknown form of Pokémon. However, a mysterious Pokémon begins causing chaos in the southern part of the region. Nathan must then help resolve the issue and understand more about the origin of these new mysterious Pokémon forms.

The game's story unfolds at a significantly different pace from the series' standard. The game map comprises the cities of Nimbasa, Castelia, and their surroundings. Instead of traveling throughout the region, you'll explore a small map filled with interactions and side quests. This allows you to thoroughly explore each part, interact with all the characters, dive straight into the main quest, or take it bit by bit at your own pace.

The main story is about 4 hours long, but the game can last 10+ hours depending on how many sidequests you choose to play.
