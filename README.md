Pokemon fan game that focuses on a rich story and the exploration of a small open world full of sidequests. Made with [Pokémon Essentials](https://github.com/Maruno17/pokemon-essentials) v19.1 and RPG Maker XP.

For now, Pokemon Burning Scales is only available in Portuguese. I plan to start translating it into English as soon as I finish the main story.

## Story

In Pokemon Burning Scales you play as Nathan, a pokemon trainer that has traveled around the world. In the past months, he's staying in Unova, helping professor Juniper in her research about a new unknown pokemon form. But a mysterious pokemon starts to cause trouble in the southern part of Unova. Nathan, then, needs to solve this new problem while trying to understand more about the origin of these mysterious new pokemon forms.
