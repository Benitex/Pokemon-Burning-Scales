Pokemon fan game that focuses on a rich story and on the exploration of a small open world full of sidequests. Made with Pokémon Essentials v19.1 and RPG Maker XP.

For now, Pokemon Burning Scales is only available in Portuguese. I plan to start translating it into English as soon as I finish the main story.

## Story

In Pokemon Burning Scales you play as Nathan, a pokemon trainer that has traveled around the world. In the past months, he's staying in Unova, helping professor Juniper in her researches about a new unknown pokemon form. But a mysterious pokemon starts to cause trouble in the southern part of Unova. Nathan, then, needs to solve this new problem while trying to understand more about the origin of these mysterious new pokemon forms.

## Features

* **A different story.** Perfect for the ones that are tired of defeating gym leaders and the Elite 4.
* **A small open world to travel.** Although there aren't many routes and cities, they are available since the beginning of the game.
* **Wild pokemon and trainers auto-level scaling**.
* **A lot of sidequests**. That can generate hours of extra content apart from the main story.
* **Choices that impact the story**, reveal additional information and provide funny situations.
* **A difficulty system**, with three different options based pokémon in your party levels.
* **Pokémon walking on the routes**.
* **Different pokemon depending on the time of the day**.
* **A few pokemon with altered forms**.

### Quality of life

* **Perfect IVs mode** (optional).
* **Super easy EV grind**, with the option to maximize EVs by defeating certain trainers or by using cheaper vitamins.
* **Auto saving** (optional).

### Plugin features

* **Quests System**. That shows all your registered quests, including your next objectives and locations. Using [Modern Quest System](https://reliccastle.com/resources/709/).
* **A system that shows available pokemon in the route.** And which were already captured or seen. Using [Encounter List UI](https://reliccastle.com/resources/658/).
* **Nuzlocke and randomizer modes**. Using [Elite Battle DX](https://luka-sj.com/res/ebdx).
* **Wonder Trade-like system**, you can spend money to get a random pokemon in its first form. Using [Random Pokemon Selector](https://reliccastle.com/resources/693/).

### Balance Changes

* **Ice Type Buff**, ice type pokemon resist to ice, water, flying and ground moves. Hail increases ice types defense by 50%.
* **Bug Type Buff**, bug type pokemon resist fairy, psychic and dark type moves, in adition to its original resistances. Bug type moves are supereffective against fairy types and neutral against fighting types.
