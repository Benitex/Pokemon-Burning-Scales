# NOTE: The id_number is only used to determine the order of the status icons in
#       the graphics containing them. Number 0 (:NONE) is ignored; they start
#       with status 1.
#       "Graphics/Pictures/statuses.png" also contains icons for being fainted
#       and for having PokÃ©rus, in that order, at the bottom of the graphic.
#       "Graphics/Pictures/Battle/icon_statuses.png" also contains an icon for
#       bad poisoning (toxic), at the bottom of the graphic.
#       Both graphics automatically handle varying numbers of defined statuses.
