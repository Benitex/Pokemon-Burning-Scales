# This section was created solely for you to put various bits of code that
# modify various wild Pokémon and trainers immediately prior to battling them.
# Be sure that any code you use here ONLY applies to the Pokémon/trainers you
# want it to apply to!

# Make all wild Pokémon shiny while a certain Switch is ON (see Settings).
Events.onWildPokemonCreate += proc { |_sender, e|

# Used in the random dungeon map.  Makes the levels of all wild Pokémon in that
# map depend on the levels of Pokémon in the player's party.
# This is a simple method, and can/should be modified to account for evolutions
# and other such details.  Of course, you don't HAVE to use this code.
# Events.onWildPokemonCreate += proc { |_sender, e|
#   pokemon = e[0]
#   if $game_map.map_id == 51
#     new_level = pbBalancedLevel($Trainer.party) - 4 + rand(5)   # For variety
#     new_level = new_level.clamp(1, GameData::GrowthRate.max_level)
#     pokemon.level = new_level
#     pokemon.calc_stats
#     pokemon.reset_moves
#   end
# }

# This is the basis of a trainer modifier. It works both for trainers loaded
# when you battle them, and for partner trainers when they are registered.
# Note that you can only modify a partner trainer's Pokémon, and not the trainer
# themselves nor their items this way, as those are generated from scratch
# before each battle.
#Events.onTrainerPartyLoad += proc { |_sender, trainer|
#  if trainer   # An NPCTrainer object containing party/items/lose text, etc.
