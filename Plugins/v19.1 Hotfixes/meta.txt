#
#=====================================================================
#
# Some graphics cards have trouble with drawing all the images they
# should, usually via blt (e.g. type icons in the summary screen,
# badges in the Trainer Card). The mkxp.json file included in this
# plugin will most likely fix this. It should be put in the project's
# main folder (replacing the one already in there).
#
# If you don't want to just replace the whole file, the changes are
# that it sets the following options (so make the same changes
# yourself):
#
#     "subImageFix": true
#     "enableBlitting": false
#
# This is NOT a fix for the "green lines all over the screen" issue.
