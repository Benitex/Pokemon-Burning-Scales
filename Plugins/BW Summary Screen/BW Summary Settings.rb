# Below, there is a bunch of variables that you can set to make some small 
# changes in BW Summary. The instructions for each option are listed right below 
# its function. If you have any trouble figuring out what any Option do or if you 
# find the text incoherent or hard to understand, please send a message in the 
# original post that I'll try to fix it. Thanks in advance, for your time =D

SHOW_IV_RATINGS = true

# If TRUE, it makes Lucidious89's IV star script by Tommaniacal visible in Page 3 
# of the Summary Screen.

SHOW_EV_IV = false

# If TRUE, it shows EVs and IVs in Summary visible in Page 3 of the Summary Screen.

SUMMARY_B2W2_STYLE = true

# If TRUE, it changes the Summary Screen BW to B2W2 style.

INVERTED_SHADOW_STATS = false

# If TRUE, it inverts the Increasing EV from Nature Shadow Text. Usually, the 
# Increased Stat Text Shadow is Red and the Deacresed Stat Text Shadow is Blue. 
# This option inverts this dynamic, so it makes it easier to tell them apart in a hurry.
